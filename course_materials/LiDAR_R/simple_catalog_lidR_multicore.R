# lidR supports parallel computation of project/catalog. 
# https://rdrr.io/cran/lidR/man/lidR-parallelism.html
# Parallelization is based on chunks. By default 1 chunk = 1 file.
# It is possible to define also chunks smaller than the file. 
# This increases the complexity of calculation and calculation time a little bit.
# But reduces the required memory significantly. 
# The number of workers should be equal or smaller than the number of chunks.
# In this example 4 workers are used.
# All lidR functions support using workers.

#Enabling this will print out a little bit more info about the parallelization plan used.
