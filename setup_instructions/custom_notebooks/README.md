# Notebooks 

[CSC Notebooks](https://notebooks.csc.fi) is a service where you can launch Jupyter Lab/Notebooks or RStudio instances. You can either use existing notebooks containers or, if you have special requirements, you can also create the docker containers yourself and upload them to the Rahti container registry.
