# Single GeoServer VM for teaching
The aim of this guide is to set up GeoServer for a university course with the following characteristics:
- The same GeoServer instance is used by several students.
- Students upload their data using QGIS [GeoServer Explorer plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/geoserverexplorer/).

The installation is done using [GeoServer "Platform Independent Binary" installation package](http://geoserver.org/release/stable/), which includes built-in Jetty servlet container. The basic installation has been modified so that the GeoServer is started at boot time (see details below).

After the installation, some settings are modified from GeoServer web admin interface.

## How GeoServer is used by the students
- The students have only access to the GeoServer web GUI and REST API.
- All students share the same GeoServer "student" user account.
- The students have access to most of the administrator functionality of GeoServer.
- The students have no shh access to the web server machine.
- The exercise instructions ask the students to be careful with the GeoServer general definitions (that affect the whole platform) and are request to limit their edits to their own Workspaces.
- The student creates its own named Workspace where edits are made adding and editing stores, layers, styles... (also named with the student's name).

## Course GeoServer installation
Follow these instruction to set up a GeoServer VM for a course with the above mentoined specifications.

If you need such a GeoServer VM, and you are a CSC's customer,  you can also request for a ready VM image from servicedesk@csc.fi.


### Basic GeoServer installation
Start with the basic installation of a GeoServer virtual machine as described in:
- [Basic GeoServer installation](basic_geoserver_jetty.md).
- To allow for JavaScript applications to run, enable CORS as specified in the  from the installatione the [Basic GeoServer installation](basic_geoserver_jetty.md) optional settings section.

### Adding a `student` user
To limit (a little bit) what students can do with the GeoServer, make them a separate user account. Here students are still given a lot of permissions, depending on your course exercises, it might make sense to limit more.
- Modify the `GROUP_ADMIN` role to have `ADMIN` role as parent (gives full admin capabilities)
- Add a user named `student` with `GROUP_ADMIN` role

Potential problems with the `student` account having administrator rights:
- Students can edit GeoServer general details that affect everyone
- Students can change Admin and student passwords (on purpose or by simply testing what it does), locking everyone out
- Students can see, edit, delete other student's work and settings

Preparations for problem situations:
- if student password is changed, Admin user can reset
- if admin password is changed, student user can reset
- if Admin and student password is changed, master password needs to be used
  - login as "root", password is same as for Admin
  - edit the Admin password to original value
- if students delete other students work, try to recover from a backup of the data directory (not yet implemented in the installation instructions above).

### Contact info (optional)
You can add some general information to GeoServer to indicate course specific details. For example:
- Add course/department specific details to the GeoServer [contact information](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/configuration/contact.html)
