## Routing using Python igraph or networkx package with multiprocessing

Here you can find example code for doing network routing in Puhti with Python igraph or networkx package. For reading the data from OpenStreetMap osmnx package is used. Osmnx can create network data needed by networkx directly. For igraph the data has to be save in GraphML format first, and then igraph can read from GraphML. In general igraph is faster and requires less memory, while networkx might be easier to use.

Files:
* osmnx-graphml.py - how to create a graph in GraphML format from OpenStreetMap data.
* igraph_parallel.py and nx_parallel.py - how to run shortest path analysis with igraph and networkx in parallel with multiprocessing module.
* batch_igarph.sh and batch_nx.sh - batch job files for submitting the shortest paths scripts to batch job system in Taito.

Notes:
* Creating GraphML file from OpenStreetMap data with osmnx requires a lot of memory as osmnx uses networkx graphs. Downloading from overpass API is suitable for only smaller areas.
* Memory consumption increases with parallelisation, but not by much
* Parallelisation is done within one node, in Puhti up to 40 cores and 382GB memory (or 1.5TB in hugemem queue) can be used.
