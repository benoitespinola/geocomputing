#Partition you want to submit your job to. Possible values are serial, parallel, longrun, hugemem and test. In this excerecise we use test as it is for testing, but it shouldn't be used for serious work. See [Taito user guide](https://research.csc.fi/taito-constructing-a-batch-job-file) for details.
